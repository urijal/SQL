--For this project I downloaded data from Kaggle, created table to insert the data in SQLite and queried data to answer some of the questions mentioned below. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.SpotifyData(
id INTEGER Primary Key,
artist_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
track_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
track_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
popularity INTEGER NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3)NOT NULL,
energy decimal (4,3) NOT NULL,
key INTEGER NOT NULL,
loudness decimal (5,3) NOT NULL,
mode INTEGER NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4)NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5)NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4)NOT NULL,
valence decimal (5,4) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal (6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
time_signature INTEGER NOT NULL);

SELECT *FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData LIMIT 5;

--First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist. 

SELECT artist_name, AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name;

--How many artist have more two songs with popularity greater than 90.
Select COUNT(artist_name), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
WHERE popularity >90
GROUP BY artist_name;

--Which one is the most popular song with highest energy song/
SELECT track_name,popularity, energy
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity DESC, energy DESC LIMIT 1;

--Top 5 songs by their danceability.
SELECT track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY danceability DESC LIMIT 5;
